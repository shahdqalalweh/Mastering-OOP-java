# Mastering OOP with Java 🧠✨

This repository is part of my personal learning journey to **master Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Java.

I'm gradually building my understanding of core OOP concepts through **hands-on mini projects**, each focused on a specific topic — all organized neatly inside the `src` folder.

---

## 🔍 What's inside?

📁 **`src/`** — All OOP learning projects are located here.  
Each folder represents a key OOP concept:

- `classes_and_objects` – Basic structure of a class and object creation.
- `encapsulation` – Data hiding using access modifiers and getters/setters.
- `inheritance` – Code reuse through class hierarchies.
- `polymorphism` – Dynamic behavior using overridden methods.
- `abstraction` – Hiding implementation details using abstract classes.
- `interfaces` – Working with multiple inheritance through interfaces.
- `final_project` – A complete example combining all concepts together.

---

## 🚀 Goal

To become confident in writing clean, structured Java code by understanding and applying OOP principles through practical coding.

Feel free to explore the code — and remember to open the `src` folder to see the full structure and examples 👀✨
